Fixed the first page, accidentally had it calling itself instead of the second level page

The pages links sorta work, when you click on the logo it won't change pages, but the second and third level pages work.

you have to use firefox as well, it wasn't working with chrome so I gave firefox a try and for some reason it worked.  since he will be testing it on firefox i think that it will be fine.

NavBar is working completely, I put in custom icons as well.  It stays at the bottom and will switch to the different pages.  

So Basically once we get the pages linked and the home and back buttons working, we should be good.

Still working on the about, It is almost done, the navbar for some reason wants to scrunch up against the left side, I am not sure why.

In the folder JQuery there is a file called about.js This is the file where the information for the about, work and play stuff is kept.  I filled in mine, obviously you will have to fill in the info you want about yourself.

Mainly once we get the pages to link together, the assignment will be pretty much done I think.
